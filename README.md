### Code for Fooling Perturbation-Based Explainability Methods

Targeted Experiments can be replicated by executing the following files from within their folder:


- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\compas_experiment.py`
- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\cc_experiment.py`
- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\german_experiment.py`


Cross effectivity experiments can be replicated by executing the following files from within their folder:


- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\compas_mix_models.py`
- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\cc_mix_models.py`
- `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP\german_mix_models.py`


Requirements of requirements files in `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP` and `Code\EXPLAN` as well as additional requirements necessary.

Some Code in `Code\Fooling-LIME-SHAP` is changed and added from the [original repository](https://github.com/dylan-slack/Fooling-LIME-SHAP). 
Contents of `Code\EXPLAN` are taken from its [original repository](https://github.com/peymanrasouli/EXPLAN).
